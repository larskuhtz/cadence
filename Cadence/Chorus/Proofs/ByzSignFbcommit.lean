/-! # `Chorus` proofs — action `byz_sign_fbcommit`

Scaffolded by `#gen_proof_files Chorus`; yours to edit. Proves every
registered VC of `byz_sign_fbcommit` cross-file from the module's persisted VC registry
(`veil.gen.vcRegistry`), persists them as kernel-checked theorems in this
file's olean, and emits the per-action preservation lemma consumed by
`Certify.lean`'s `#gen_composition`.

Manual cells go on `#prove_vc Chorus byz_sign_fbcommit <property> by <tac>` lines
*before* the `#prove_action` — it consumes them as-is after a statement
check. Solver options are read in this file at tactic runtime (no
`#gen_spec` capture applies on the cross-file path). -/
